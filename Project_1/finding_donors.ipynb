    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given that our data is not that massive in terms of number of records (rows), and the outcome is a binary outcome (1,0),  then pretty much any of the classifiers in theory should work including those binary classifiers by nature (such as Logistic Regression and SVM). If the data was very large, then the choices will be different since some algorithms work better with large data while others deteriorate. For example, SVM scales poorly when data is extremely large while SGD classifier performs much better with larger data.\n",
    "Notes about the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have `103` fearures that we need to figure out their weights. There will be several that probably have less influence than others.\n",
    "* There are few interesting facts with the data:\n",
    "  * **Class Imbalance** it’s a 75/25 split with majority at `<=50K`\n",
    "  * Additionally some interesting observations about our data: if we look at `Workclass= Private` it comprises 74% of the instances, same with `race=white` at 86% and `native-country=United States` at 91%\n",
    "* For the Algorithms, I will pick one of the Ensemble methods (Adaboost) since they in general designed to tackle the main issue with DecisionTree classifiers (overfitting), they each have their unique strengths but given the nature of the problem I would like to explore completely different algorithms before deciding how to proceed after initial testing. So, I will try `AdaBoost`, `Naive Bayes`, and `SVM`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdaBoost\n",
    "What I like about AdaBoost is the idea behind using weak classifiers that learn from their mistakes and convert them into a stronger one. It is sequential in natures, starting with a base weak classifier i.e. DecisionTree and then penalize the wrong answers so the next learner in line improves upon that and so on.\n",

    "\n",
    "> - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that it can use a combination of weak classifiers or algorithms gives it an advantage of being faster, since each step of the process a weak \"learner\" tries to improve on the mistakes done by the previous learner (progressive/gradual learning). This specificity I think will make the overall computational process more efficient (fast), and produce the best results.  In Scikit-Learn, there are less parameters to tune as compared to SVM for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above, I can also see that as being a weakness. What if one of the weak learners (e.g. base learner) was extremely off, this would mean more time for the other learners to improve upon that deviation or it can become a distraction (deviate) for other learners to focus on an anomaly/noise when they shouldn't. So, what gives this algorithm it's strength, is also a cause of it's weakness, and that could be dependent on the data or selection of the weak learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "> - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data? \n",
    "\n",
    "Tree based classifiers are amazingly simple and easy to interpret and would be perfect for this problem, but the issue with Decision Trees is that they will overfit. So, AdaBoost is a great ensemble method that will be robust, quick and possibly immune to overfitting. The data doesn't have much noise (no extreme outliers) so it should perform and converge.\n",

    "A very simple (based on simple assumptions) and easy to implement, yet a powerful algorithm that produces great results. Unlike other algorithms in sklearn it requires no special hyperparameter, used as is out of the box. It's faster compared to let's say tree or ensemble methods were depth or number of weak learners can impact performance. It doesn't need a lot of data, and is more robust to noise than Adaboost. \n",
    "\n",
    "My concern is that it may not work well with imbalanced data, since it is probability based algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "> - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?  \n",
    "\n",
    "I feel the naive assumption made, though can produce great results, can also be problematic specifically around the assumption of independence (independent predictors) and if this doesn't hold true then it may not produce good results. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many hyperparameters to pick and tune which can make it complicated. Additioanlly, it can overfit when choosing the wrong parameter values so more care is needed when implementing SVM. Adding to that choosing the proper Kernel, and then the specific parameters that belong for that kernel adds layer of complexity in implementing the model. \n",

    "* Given we have class imbalance, accuracy would be a misleading measure. Instead, F1-score (using fbeta) that leans more toward precision (we care more that if we predict we have are more confident that we predict the right class). With that in mind, Adaboost outperforms especially on the test data. SVC did good on the Train with a slight drop on testing, still not significant drop to accuse it of overfitting. But if I consider F1-score, and computaitonal time, Adaboost is a winner. Adaboost also did better on the smaller subset and the larger subset. In the smaller dataset it was overfitting, but then adjusted with more data. SVC did poorly with the smaller subset. \n",

    "\n",
    "A little more insight, the model chosen has performed the best in terms of speed and overall scoring (making good predictions). The technique we used is called Adaboost, pretty much it's a technique were we use weak models (think of it like random guessing, but slightly better), then the next step is another weak learner that tries to improve on the initial guess to fix it, though it may make some mistakes, then the next learner picks up from that and improves upon it and this cycel goes on until we get as many of the mistakes fixed. This is a sequential process but pretty quick. It is exactly how humans learn from their past mistakes and improve upon it. "

    "1. Education (`education-num`) - the more years of education the higher the salary which also related to `education` class so it's kinda redundant but we can't also make assumptions that someone whoe spent 22 years has more than BS degree.\n",
    "2. Occupation - which is related to Education in a way and also `hours-per-week` depending on if it's full time or contrat ..etc. Certain occupations will earn higher salary, and they are full-time jobs not contract then possibly 40-hours a week\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "If we narrow our features to the top-5 then the model did not perform better, it actually got worse in both measures. Both accuracy and F-score dropped. Though we care about F-score more, the drop I feel is significant. If training time was a factor, I would use a different approach for dimensionality reduction and rely on how the feature importance of the model. The feature importance gave us top 5, that does not mean the other features are ZERO (or out), so in reality the model uses all features though lower weights on the remaining features."
